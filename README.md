# The Ultimate Turbo Modal for Rails (UTMR)

There are MANY Turbo/Hotwire/Stimulus modal dialog implementations out there. However, as you may have learned, the majority fall short in different, often subtle ways. They generally cover the basics quite well, but do not check all the boxes for real-world use.

UTMR aims to be the be-all and end-all of Turbo Modals. I believe it is the best (only?) full-featured implementation and checks all the boxes. It is feature-rich, yet extremely easy to use. Its purpose is to make it as easy as possible to have polished Turbo-backed modals and drawers.

Under the hood, it uses [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev), [Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/), the native HTML [`<dialog>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog) element, and [Idiomorph](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/idiomorph).

It ships in two flavors: Tailwind (v4+) and vanilla CSS. It is easy to create your own flavor to suit your needs.

## Installation

```
$ bundle add ultimate_turbo_modal
$ bundle exec rails g ultimate_turbo_modal:install
```


## Usage

1. Wrap your view inside a `modal` block as follow:

```erb
<%= modal do %>
  Hello World!
<% end %>
```

2. Link to your view by specifying `modal` as the target Turbo Frame:

```erb
<%= link_to "Open Modal", "/hello_world", data: { turbo_frame: "modal" } %>
```

Clicking on the link will automatically open the content of the view inside a modal. If you open the link in a new tab, it will render normally outside of the modal. Nothing to do!

This is really all you should need to do for most use cases.

**Please note:** The generator automatically adds `<turbo-frame id="modal"></turbo-frame>` to your application layout. If you need to open modals or drawers in another layout, please add this HTML snippet manually.

### Setting Title and Footer

You can set a custom title and footer by passing a block. For example:

```erb
<%= modal do |m| %>
  <% m.title do %>
    <div>My Title</div>
  <% end %>

  <p>Your modal body</p>
  <%= form_with url: "#", html: { id: "myform" } do |f| %>
    <p>..</p>
  <% end %>

  <% m.footer do %>
    <input type="submit" form="myform">Submit</input>
  <% end %>
<% end %>
```

You can also set a title with options (see below).

### Detecting modal at render time

If you need to do something a little bit more advanced when the view is shown outside of a modal, you can use the `#inside_modal?` method as such:

```erb
<% if inside_modal? %>
  <h1 class="text-2xl mb-8">Hello from modal</h1>
<% else %>
  <h1 class="text-2xl mb-8">Hello from a normal page render</h1>
<% end %>
```



&nbsp;

## Options

Do not get overwhelmed with all the options. The defaults are sensible. You can change the defaults with an initializer:

```ruby
# config/initializers/ultimate_turbo_modal.rb

UltimateTurboModal.configure do |config|
  config.flavor = :tailwind
  config.allowed_click_outside_selector = []

  config.modal do |m|
    m.advance = false
    m.close_button = true
    m.close_on_submit = true
    m.header = true
    m.header_divider = true
    m.footer_divider = true
    m.padding = true
    m.overlay = true
  end

  config.drawer do |d|
    d.position = :right
    d.advance = false
    d.close_button = true
    d.close_on_submit = true
    d.header = true
    d.header_divider = false
    d.footer_divider = true
    d.padding = true
    d.overlay = true
    d.size = :md
  end
end
```

Per-instance options passed to `modal()` or `drawer()` override the defaults.

### Modal Options

| Name | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `advance` | `false` | When opening the modal, the URL in the URL bar will change to the URL of the view being shown in the modal. The Back button dismisses the modal and navigates back. If a URL is specified as a string (e.g. `advance: "/other-path"`), the browser history will advance, and the URL shown in the URL bar will be replaced with the value specified. |
| `close_button` | `true` | Shows or hide a close button (X) at the top right of the modal. |
| `close_on_submit` | `true` | Whether a successful form submission dismisses the modal. See [Closing on form submission](#closing-on-form-submission). |
| `header` | `true` | Whether to display a modal header. |
| `header_divider` | `true` | Whether to display a divider below the header. |
| `footer_divider` | `true` | Whether to display a divider above the footer. |
| `padding` | `true` | Adds padding inside the modal. |
| `overlay` | `true` | Whether to show a backdrop overlay. |
| `title` | `nil` | Title to display in the modal header. Alternatively, you can set the title with a block. |

### Example usage with options

```erb
<%= modal(padding: true, close_button: false, advance: false) do %>
  Hello World!
<% end %>
```

```erb
<%= modal(padding: true, close_button: false, advance: "/foo/bar") do %>
  Hello World!
<% end %>
```

## Drawers

UTMR includes built-in drawer (slide-out panel) support. Drawers share the same `<dialog>` element and Stimulus controller as modals — no additional JavaScript required.

### Basic Usage

Use the `drawer` helper instead of `modal`:

```erb
<%= drawer do %>
  Drawer content here!
<% end %>
```

Link to it the same way as a modal:

```erb
<%= link_to "Open Drawer", "/settings", data: { turbo_frame: "modal" } %>
```

### Drawer Options

| Name | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `position` | `:right` | Which edge the drawer slides from. `:right` or `:left`. |
| `size` | `:md` | Width of the drawer. One of `:xs`, `:sm`, `:md`, `:lg`, `:xl`, `:"2xl"`, `:full`, or a CSS string (e.g. `"500px"`). |
| `advance` | `false` | When opening the drawer, the URL in the URL bar will change to the URL of the view being shown in the drawer. The Back button dismisses the drawer and navigates back. If a URL is specified as a string (e.g. `advance: "/other-path"`), the browser history will advance, and the URL shown in the URL bar will be replaced with the value specified. |
| `overlay` | `true` | Whether to show a backdrop overlay behind the drawer. |
| `close_button` | `true` | Shows or hide a close button (X). |
| `close_on_submit` | `true` | Whether a successful form submission dismisses the drawer. See [Closing on form submission](#closing-on-form-submission). |
| `header` | `true` | Whether to display a header. |
| `header_divider` | `false` | Whether to display a divider below the header. |
| `footer_divider` | `true` | Whether to display a divider above the footer. |
| `padding` | `true` | Adds padding inside the drawer. |
| `title` | `nil` | Title to display in the drawer header. |

```erb
<%= drawer(position: :left, size: :lg, overlay: false, title: "Settings") do %>
  <p>Drawer content</p>
<% end %>
```

### Drawer Size Reference

| Size | Max Width |
|------|-----------|
| `:sm` | 24rem (384px) |
| `:md` | 28rem (448px) |
| `:lg` | 42rem (672px) |
| `:xl` | 56rem (896px) |
| `:full` | Full viewport width minus a small gutter |
| CSS string | Custom value, e.g. `"500px"` or `"50vw"` |


## Closing on form submission

By default, a form submitted inside a modal or drawer dismisses it once the
submission succeeds. Set `close_on_submit: false` to keep it open instead —
useful for chat composers, image uploaders, inline "add another" forms, and
anything else where the user is expected to submit repeatedly:

```erb
<%= drawer(title: "Messages", close_on_submit: false) do %>
  <%= render "messages/list" %>
  <%= form_with model: Message.new do |f| %>
    <%= f.text_field :body %>
    <%= f.submit "Send" %>
  <% end %>
<% end %>
```

Respond with a Turbo Stream to update the contents in place, and send
`turbo_stream.modal(:close)` from the server on the submissions that *should*
dismiss it.

Two things are worth calling out:

- **Failed submissions never dismiss.** A 422 rendering validation errors leaves
  the modal open regardless of this setting, so errors are shown in place.
- **Redirects still dismiss.** If the server redirects to a page that doesn't
  contain the modal frame, the browser is navigating away and the modal closes
  (smoothly) even with `close_on_submit: false`.

### Per-form overrides

`data-modal-close-on-submit` on a form overrides the setting for that form
alone, so a single modal can mix both behaviors:

```erb
<%= drawer(title: "Messages", close_on_submit: false) do %>
  <%# Stays open — inherits close_on_submit: false %>
  <%= form_with model: Message.new do |f| %>
    <%= f.text_field :body %>
    <%= f.submit "Send" %>
  <% end %>

  <%# Dismisses the drawer, despite close_on_submit: false %>
  <%= form_with model: @conversation, method: :delete,
                data: { modal_close_on_submit: true } do |f| %>
    <%= f.submit "Delete conversation" %>
  <% end %>
<% end %>
```

It works in both directions: `data: { modal_close_on_submit: false }` on a form
inside a default modal keeps that one form from dismissing it. Placing the
attribute on a wrapping element applies it to every form inside; the nearest
one wins.

## Opening a Modal from a Drawer

You don't need to do anything special. Use `data-turbo-frame="modal"` like you would anywhere else, and UTMR handles the rest:

```erb
<%= drawer(title: "Notifications") do %>
  <p>Activity list here…</p>
  <%= link_to "Edit preferences",
        edit_preferences_path,
        data: { turbo_frame: "modal" } %>
<% end %>
```

```erb
<%= modal(title: "Notification preferences") do %>
  <p>Form here…</p>
<% end %>
```

The same partial works inside a drawer or out — outside, it opens a regular modal; inside, it stacks on top of the drawer.

### Behavior

- **ESC** closes the modal first, then the drawer (native top-layer behavior).
- **Click outside** the modal closes the modal only; the drawer stays open.
- **`turbo_stream.modal(:close)`** closes the topmost dialog (the modal).
- **Form submission with same-page redirect** closes the modal smoothly; the drawer stays.
- **Form submission with a different-page redirect** closes both dialogs, then navigates.
- **Closing the drawer** (via close button, ESC after the modal closes, etc.) also tears down any modal opened from it.

### Constraints

- Modal-from-drawer only. You cannot open a drawer from inside a modal, and you cannot stack a modal on top of another modal. The `drawer-modal` frame is only rendered inside drawers.
- Stacked modals always force `advance: false` (history is not pushed). All other modal options (overlay, padding, header, footer, etc.) work normally.
- Both backdrops are drawn when both dialogs have `overlay: true`. Pass `overlay: false` to the inner modal if you don't want the drawer to look slightly darker while the modal is open.

For a full lifecycle walkthrough and edge-case notes, see [docs/modal-from-drawer.md](docs/modal-from-drawer.md).


## Features and capabilities

- Extremely easy to use
- Built-in drawer (slide-out panel) support with left/right positioning and configurable sizes
- Fully responsive
- Does not break if a user navigates directly to a page that is usually shown in a modal
- Opening a modal in a new browser tab (ie: right click) gracefully degrades without having to code a modal and non-modal version of the same page
- Automatically handles URL history (ie: pushState) for shareable URLs
- pushState URL optionally overrideable
- Seamless support for multi-page navigation within the modal
- Seamless support for forms with validations
- Seamless support for Rails flash messages
- Support for long, scrollable modals
- Properly locks the background page when scrolling a long modal
- Click outside the modal to dismiss
- Option to whitelist CSS selectors that won't dismiss the modal when clicked outside the modal (see [body-appended widgets guide](docs/body-appended-widgets.md) for datepickers and similar popups)
- Keyboard control; ESC to dismiss
- Automatic (or not) close button
- Native focus trapping via the `<dialog>` element for improved accessibility (Tab and Shift+Tab cycle through focusable elements within the modal only)
- Smooth redirects: form submissions that redirect back to the same page morph the content behind the modal before closing; redirects to a different page close the modal with animation first, then navigate


### Running the Demo Application

The repository includes a demo application in the `demo-app` directory that showcases all the features of Ultimate Turbo Modal. To run it locally:

```bash
# Navigate to the demo app directory
cd demo-app
