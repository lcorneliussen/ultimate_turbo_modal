## [Unreleased]

- Added `close_on_submit`, which keeps a modal or drawer open after a successful form submission. Individual forms can override it with `data-modal-close-on-submit`.
- Drawers now support the `advance` option to push their URL to browser history, matching modals. Defaults to `false`.

## [3.2.1] - 2026-05-07

- Fixed drawers closing abruptly when pressing Escape after dismissing a modal opened from inside the drawer.
- Fixed `inside_modal?` returning false when navigating between pages inside an open modal or drawer.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-05-05

- Links and forms inside a drawer can now use `data-turbo-frame="modal"` to open a stacked modal — the same partial works inside or outside a drawer with no changes.
- Fixed scroll-lock not releasing after a same-page morph reconnected the modal controller, which could leave the page padded and right-anchored fixed elements offset until refresh.

## [3.1.2] - 2026-05-01

- Fixed page content shifting right when a modal or drawer opens.

## [3.1.1] - 2026-05-01

- Fixed validation errors and multi-step forms inside a stacked modal closing the modal instead of updating in place.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-05-01

- Tweaked vertically centering of modals on desktop (≥640px) with a slight optical-center bias, instead of anchoring them near the top.
- Added support for opening a modal from inside a drawer. See [docs/modal-from-drawer.md](docs/modal-from-drawer.md).
- Fixed a race in `closeAllDialogs` when a stacked modal redirected off-page, which could leave a dialog open or animations in a bad state.

## [3.0.5] - 2026-04-22

- Fixed modal being dismissed when a body-appended widget (e.g. flatpickr, Select2, Tippy) opens over its trigger between mousedown and mouseup. The browser fires `click` on the dialog (common ancestor), which was treated as a backdrop dismissal. The dialog now tracks mousedown origin and skips dismissal when the press started inside content.

## [3.0.4] - 2026-04-08

- Fixed form fields not being auto-focused inside modals due to an unnecessary `invisible` class on the modal inner container.

## [3.0.3] - 2026-03-23

- Switched importmap CDN from JSPM to jsdelivr for more reliable package resolution.

## [3.0.2] - 2026-03-22

- Fixed npm package not being found on JSPM, which prevented `bin/importmap pin` from working ([#46](https://github.com/cmer/ultimate_turbo_modal/issues/46)).

## [3.0.1] - 2026-03-21

- Fixed missing bottom padding on vanilla flavor drawer header when header divider is enabled.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-03-21

Upgrading is easy! See [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md)

- **BREAKING**: Replaced div-based modal with native HTML `<dialog>` element. 
- **BREAKING**: If you customized the look and feel of a flavor, you'll need to reapply your customizations since the underlying markup has changed.
- **BREAKING**: Removed Tailwind v3 flavor. Use the `tailwind` flavor (Tailwind v4+) or `custom` to define your own classes.
- **BREAKING**: Configuration options are now split between `config.modal` and `config.drawer` blocks instead of flat on the config object. See UPGRADING.md for migration details.
- **BREAKING**: Rails 8+ now required.
- Added support for slide-out drawers with separate default configuration.
- Smooth redirect behavior: same-page redirects morph content behind modal/drawer before closing; different-page redirects close modal/drawer with animation before navigating.
- Removed `el-transition` and `focus-trap` npm dependencies.
- ... plus a million tweaks, optimizations, refactors, etc.
